## Description

The Cross-Border Payment Smart Contract is a decentralized solution built on the Aptos blockchain that enables seamless international money transfers using cryptocurrency. This Move-based smart contract eliminates traditional banking intermediaries, reducing transaction fees and processing times for cross-border payments.

The contract provides a secure, transparent, and efficient way for users to send and receive payments across international borders. It maintains detailed transaction records for each user, including balance tracking and comprehensive payment history, while ensuring all transactions are recorded on the blockchain for full transparency and immutability.

## Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize the global remittance and cross-border payment industry by:

- **Democratizing Financial Access**: Making international payments accessible to everyone, regardless of their location or banking status
- **Eliminating Financial Barriers**: Removing the need for traditional banking infrastructure and reducing dependency on legacy financial systems
- **Promoting Financial Inclusion**: Providing unbanked and underbanked populations with access to global financial services
- **Creating Economic Opportunities**: Enabling seamless international commerce and trade for businesses of all sizes
- **Building a Borderless Economy**: Contributing to a world where financial transactions flow freely across geographical boundaries

We envision a future where sending money internationally is as simple as sending a text message, with minimal fees, instant settlement, and complete transparency.
